These heuristic algorithms are based on an initial choice of customer delivery days which meet the service level requirements, followed by an interchange procedure in an attempt to minimize distribution costs. The heuristic algorithms represent distribution costs by replacing the vehicle routing problem for each day of the period by (i) a median problem and (ii) a traveling salesman problem. Computational results and comparisons are given for the algorithms, based on test problems derived from the literature with up to 126 customers. The largest of these problems is the one given and solved by Russell and Igo. The solution obtained for this problem by the heuristic algorithms shows an improvement of 13\% over the previous best solution.},

@article{johnson_asymptotic_nodate,
	title = {Asymptotic {Experimental} {Analysis} for the {Held}-{Karp} {Traveling} {Salesman} {Bound}},
	abstract = {The Held-Karp (HK) lower bound is the solution to the linear programming relaxation of the standard integer programming formulation of the traveling salesman problem (TSP). For numbers of cities N up to 30,000 or more it can be computed exactly using the Simplex method and appropriate separation algorithms, and for N up to a million good approximations can be obtained via iterative Lagrangean relaxation techniques first suggested by Held and Karp. In this paper, we consider three applications of our ability to compute/approximate this bound. First, we provide empirical evidence in support of using the HK bound as a stand-in for the optimal tour length when evaluating the quality of near-optimal tours. We show that for a wide variety of randomly generated instance types the optimal tour length averages less than 0.8\% over the HK bound, and even for the real-world instances in TSPLIB the gap is almost always less than 2\%. Moreover, our data indicates that the HK bound can provide substantial “variance reduction” in experimental studies involving randomly generated instances. Second, we estimate the expected HK bound as a function of N for a variety of random instance types, basedon extensive computations. For example, for random Euclidean instances it is known that the ratio of the HeldKarp bound to fi approaches a constant CHK, and we estimate both that constant and the rate of convergence to it. Finally, we combine this information with our earlier results on expected HK gaps to obtain estimates for expected optimal tour lengths. For random Euclidean instances, we conclude that CoPT,the limiting ratio of the optimal tour length to fi, is -7124 +- .0002, thus invalidating the commonly cited estimates of .749 and ,765 and undermining many claims of good heuristic performance based on those estimates. For random distance matrices, the expected optimal tour length appearsto be about 2.042, adding support to a conjecture of Krauth and M\&ard.},

We outline the different components and concepts that are used in the different metaheuristics in order to analyze their similarities and differences. Two very important concepts in metaheuristics are intensification and diversification. These are the two forces that largely determine the behavior of a metaheuristic. They are in some way contrary but also complementary to each other. We introduce a framework, that we call the I\&D frame, in order to put different intensification and diversification components into relation with each other. Outlining the advantages and disadvantages of different metaheuristic approaches we conclude by pointing out the importance of hybridization of metaheuristics as well as the integration of metaheuristics and other methods for optimization.},

In this paper metaheuristics such as Ant Colony Optimization, Evolutionary Computation, Simulated Annealing, Tabu Search and others are introduced, and their applications to the class of Stochastic Combinatorial Optimization Problems (SCOPs) is thoroughly reviewed. Issues common to all metaheuristics, open problems, and possible directions of research are proposed and discussed. In this survey, the reader familiar to metaheuristics ﬁnds also pointers to classical algorithmic approaches to optimization under uncertainty, and useful informations to start working on this problem domain, while the reader new to metaheuristics should ﬁnd a good tutorial in those metaheuristics that are currently being applied to optimization under uncertainty, and motivations for interest in this ﬁeld.},

To distribute subproblems among the processors we use a new direct-neighbor dynamic load-balancing strategy. The general principle can be applied to all other branch-and-bound algorithms leading to an "automatic" parallelization.

	abstract = {The reverse logistics problem of the simultaneous distribution of commodities and the collection of reusable empty packages with a single depot and a single vehicle with limited capacity is addressed in this paper. Commodities to be distributed are loaded at the depot and the empty packages are transported back to the depot. This is called the traveling salesman problem with simultaneous delivery and pick-up (TSDP), a variant of the classical traveling salesman problem (TSP), where nodes require both delivery and pick-up. The objective is to minimize the total distance traveled by servicing of the all customers. We develop a mathematical programming model and a twophase heuristic to solve the TSDP. In the first phase, we use an agglomerative procedure to find an initial solution. In the second phase, we develop an enhanced version of simulated annealing (SA) to search for the best solution. We tested the heuristic on standard, derived, and randomly generated data-sets and obtained encouraging results.},

	abstract = {Understanding where traffic accidents occur is crucial for improving road safety and proper traffic enforcement allocation. One of the most common methods of analyzing traffic accidents is spatial hotspot detection. Existing hotspot detection methods, e.g., spatial scan statistics, spatial and spatiotemporal kernel density estimation, mostly focus on Euclidean space. These methods ignore an important aspect of traffic accident hotspots, i.e., traffic accident locations are constrained to road networks. Several techniques have been proposed to detect spatial hotspot on the network space, including network kernel density-estimation, and significant linear route detection, but the time dimension and temporal dynamics of hotspots are not incorporated. To address the limitations of existing methods, we demonstrated a new method called Spatial-Temporal Network Kernel Density Estimation (STNKDE) that integrates both of these features. We also developed a prototype system and visualized the dynamics of traffic accident hotspots in New York City 2017.},

It can also be use for mapping and analyzing the crime and its impact. Mapping of Crime using GIS technology can be effective in Emergency situations. Hotspots of particular crime incident can be identified for finding its intensity and for taking effective decision. Kernel Density Estimation, Getis-Ord Gi*, Moran’s I, IDW and different other methods can be used for finding the Hotspot which are discussed in this paper so that one can select the appropriate methods according to the requirement which can be of crime, forestry, tourist management, emergency crisis, wildlife reserve and many others.},

	abstract = {Introduced in this paper is a family of statistics, G, that can be used as a measure of spatial association in a number of circumstances. The basic statistic is derived, its properties are identified, and its advantages explained. Several of the G statistics make it possible to evaluate the spatial association of a variable within a specified distance of a single point. A comparison is made between a general G statistic and Moran's I for similar hypothetical and empirical conditions. The empirical work includes studies of sudden infant death syndrome by county in North Carolina and dwelling unit prices in metropolitan San Diego by zip-code districts. Results indicate that G statistics should be used in conjunction with I in order to identify characteristics of patterns not revealed by the I statistic alone and, specifically, the Gi and Gi* statistics enable us to detect local “pockets” of dependence that may not show up when using global statistics.},

	abstract = {Identifying road accident hotspots is a key role in determining effective strategies for the reduction of high density areas of accidents. This paper presents (1) a methodology using Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and Kernel Density Estimation to study the spatial patterns of injury related road accidents in London, UK and (2) a clustering methodology using environmental data and results from the ﬁrst section in order to create a classiﬁcation of road accident hotspots. The use of this methodology will be illustrated using the London area in the UK. Road accident data collected by the Metropolitan Police from 1999 to 2003 was used. A kernel density estimation map was created and subsequently disaggregated by cell density to create a basic spatial unit of an accident hotspot. Appended environmental data was then added to the hotspot cells and using K-means clustering, an outcome of similar hotspots was deciphered. Five groups and 15 clusters were created based on collision and attribute data. These clusters are discussed and evaluated according to their robustness and potential uses in road safety campaigning.},

A range of methods can be applied to point pattern analysis, from basic summary to advanced spatial statistics.

Very often areas identified as hotspots from the Gi* results are not grouped into high density threshold on the kernel density estimation map. When analyzing and mapping spatial patterns (e.g. crime patterns), it is important to ensure that the identification of hotspots is as accurate and effective as possible.},

The VRP is classified as an NP-hard problem. Hence, the use of exact optimization methods may be difficult to solve these problems in acceptable CPU times, when the problem involves real-world data sets that are very large. The vehicle routing problem comes under combinatorial problem. Hence, to get solutions in determining routes which are realistic and very close to the optimal solution, we use heuristics and meta-heuristics. In this paper we discuss the various exact methods and the heuristics and meta-heuristics used to solve the VRP and its variants.},
